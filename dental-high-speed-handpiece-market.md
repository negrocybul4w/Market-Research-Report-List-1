<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental High-Speed Handpiece Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside Exhaust Handpiece</li><li>Outside Exhaust Handpiece</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental high-speed handpiece market features two primary types based on exhaust design: inside exhaust and outside exhaust handpieces. Inside exhaust handpieces direct air and debris within the device, minimizing external contamination and enhancing visibility during procedures. In contrast, outside exhaust handpieces expel debris and air externally, which can improve cooling but may impact operatory cleanliness. Both types are essential for efficient dental procedures, but their design can influence performance, hygiene, and ease of use in clinical settings.</p></p>
