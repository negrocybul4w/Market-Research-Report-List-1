<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Cooling Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Immersion Liquid Cooling</li><li>Two-Phase Immersion Liquid Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immersion cooling solution market includes two primary types: single-phase and two-phase immersion liquid cooling. Single-phase immersion cooling involves submerging components in a dielectric liquid that remains in a single phase as it absorbs heat, providing efficient thermal management. In contrast, two-phase immersion cooling uses a liquid that evaporates into gas when heated, facilitating heat transfer through phase change. Both types enhance cooling efficiency and energy use, making them suitable for high-performance computing and data centers.</p></p>
