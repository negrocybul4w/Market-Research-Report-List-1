<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sonobuoy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sonobuoy</li><li>Passive Sonobuoy</li><li>Special Purpose Sonobuoy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sonobuoy market encompasses three main types: active sonobuoys, passive sonobuoys, and special purpose sonobuoys. Active sonobuoys emit sound waves and detect their echoes to identify underwater objects. Passive sonobuoys, on the other hand, listen for sounds generated by submarines or marine wildlife, providing valuable intelligence without emitting signals. Special purpose sonobuoys are designed for specific tasks, such as environmental monitoring or research. Collectively, these types serve vital roles in maritime surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and oceanic research.</p></p>
